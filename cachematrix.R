## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## This source file contains two functions that create's an object (makeCacheMatrix) 
## that allows caching of a matrix. Tha make function has getter and setter functions
## The solve fucntion is called to evaluate the matrix inverse. If the inverse matrix 
## already exits then this "cached" version is used. 

## Write a short comment describing this function
#setwd("~/GitHub/ploncker/ProgrammingAssignment2")

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setSolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getSolve <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get, setSolve = setSolve, getSolve = getSolve)
}

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
